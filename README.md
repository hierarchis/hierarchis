> **"Preparing the code for heavy adventure."**

Hi there! I'm a **Frontend Developer** specializing in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I merge the precision of clean code with the rugged spirit of exploration. My projects are designed to be functional, durable, and elegant.

## 🌌 About Me
- 💻 **Frontend Wizardry:** Crafting seamless interfaces and robust web experiences.
- 🏔️ **GorpCore Enthusiast:** I draw inspiration from the outdoors. Cold mornings, high peaks, and the calm of nature shape my design philosophy.
- ❄️ **Minimalist:** Clean code, like clean lines in design, speaks volumes.
